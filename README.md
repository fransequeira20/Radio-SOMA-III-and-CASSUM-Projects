This repositary contains python scripts and jupyter notebooks with the results use on the Radio SOMA paper III (in prep) and also my 2022 CASSUM project as part of my work with the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey.

## Radio SOMA III: "The SOMA Radio Survey. III. Extended Spectral Energy Distributions of Intermediate Protostars"

In this project we analyze VLA radio continuum observations of seven intermediate and high-mass regions that are part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. Using 1.3 cm (K band) and 6 cm (C band) data, we built extended spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve sources, and we also study the multiplicity, morphology, and the spectral index of the centimeter continuum data of these sources.

This plot is from region IRAS 22198 showing the IR data (37 micron) wih VLA contours of the combined radio maps overlaid.
